# 100 days of code - log (austin)

### day 0: 1 may 2024

**today's progress**: finally getting started on TOP, got everything set up today (dual-booting, git). today was mostly about refreshing some stuff that i very briefly touched, e.g. linux and git commands.

**thoughts:** i'm motivated again, gna try to keep it up. let's do this.

### day 1: 2 may 2024

**today's progress**: refreshed some html concepts + some css exercises. i mainly rushed through the html part since i am pretty familiar with it already.

**thoughts:** nothing much, just hoping i can be consistent and keep this up.
